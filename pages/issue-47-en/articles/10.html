        <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p>
        <p>Gurnak V.M., Volynets L.M., Lisniak O.L. Actual problems of prospects of logistic support of transportation of products. Visnyk National Transport University. Series &laquo;Economic sciences&raquo;. Scientific and Technical Collection. - Kyiv: National Transport University, 2020. - Issue 2 (47).</p>
        <p>The article analyzes the actual problems of prospects of logistical support of transportation of products. Automobile, railway, aviation and water modes of transport, which function and develop according to different rules and criteria, based on their departmental interests and priorities, were investigated. Conquesting and retaining competitive advantages is relevant for any mode of transport in our country at this stage of economic development. The main directions for strengthening the state transport policy which is necessary to supplement and adjust the actions of market mechanisms in order to ensure the effective, public&shy;interest formation of the state transport system and the transport services market, were formed in this article. A possible solution to the problem is the unification of hundreds of medium-sized and small motor transport companies and freight forwarding companies in one place - a multimodal transport and logistics center with the provision of logistics services. This will attract new investment in the country's transport infrastructure and increase the level of logistics services.</p>
        <p>The object of study - the process of logistical support for transportation of products.</p>
        <p>The purpose of the study is to analyze the problems of interaction and competition between different modes of transport in the modern conditions and to identify possible directions for their solution in the transport of goods and passengers in order to ensure stable economic development, satisfaction of the needs of the population and social production.</p>
        <p>Methods of research - methods of economic, system and comparative analysis.</p>
        <p>On the basis of the analysis of the interaction of different types of transport, it was discovered that during this time the cardinal transformational processes from the socialist plans to market relations and infrastructure development took place in the state economy. The specificity of activity of different modes of transport is that they not only interact, but also compete with each other in the provision of transport services. There is a big competition at the interstate level for the transit of goods. It is proved that for further growth of grain export, it is necessary not only to improve the logistics of transportation, but also to develop the infrastructure of the country. It would be appropriate to consider at the state level the possibility of prioritizing the transportation of agricultural products by different modes of transport during the peak period and to develop programs to encourage the construction of modern grain storage facilities in port areas and at the borders of Ukraine with neighboring countries.</p>
        <p>Expected assumptions about the development of the object of study - a logistic approach for sustainable economic development is proposed, conquesting and retaining competitive advantages which will allow to promptly take into account changes of the environment, to respond to the behavior of competitors and consumers, that is, provide for and form demand and supply in the prospective plan. That is why it is necessary to carry out complex measures aimed at transforming any company into a successful commercial enterprise, which will provide high-quality transport services. In general, the strategic goal is to solve three main tasks: to reduce the company's expenses, increase its income and ensure the maximum safety of movement and safekeeping of cargoes during transportation both on the territory of our state and abroad.</p>
